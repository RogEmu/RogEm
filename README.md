## What is RogEm ?
RogEm is a new generation PS1 emulator that aims to be performant, easy to use and portable between devices.
As gaming habits and game consumption evolve, we wanted to give retro-game players the ability to play on multiple platforms without hassle.
Our goal is to give players the ability to synchronize between **_their_** devices, **_their_** game saves and player data.
