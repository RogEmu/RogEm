- **Objective:** Make sure the system behaves as close as possible to the real hardware
- **Preconditions:** Gather PSX test binaries
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Build the project
  2. Run unit tests
  3. Run Amidog's CPU PSX-EXE tests
- **Expected Outcome:** Every test passes

#### **Scenario 2: Emulate a game**
- **Role Involved:** Developer/User
- **Objective:** The emulator can run the game smoothly
- **Preconditions:** Have a working PSX BIOS and a "Crash Bandicoot " ROM
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Set the BIOS file in the emulator
  2. Select the game you want to run
  3. Run the game
  4. Start a new game
  5. Play the first level of the game
  6. Jump on a crate
  7. Gather mangoes
  8. Break a crate
  9. Kill enemies while spinning the character
  10. Reach a checkpoint
  11. Die and respawn on a checkpoint
  12. Finish the level
- **Expected Outcome:** The game runs smoothly, is playable, very few unnoticeable slow-downs at worst and graphically accurate

#### **Scenario 3: Debugger**
- **Role Involved:** Developer/User
- **Objective:** Visualize and control the system states
- **Preconditions:** Have a working PSX BIOS (game ROMs are optional)
- **Test Steps:**
 1. Launch the emulator
 2. Pause execution at BIOS entry
 3. Open the debugger windows
 4. Step through the code by hand
 5. Check expected results after each step

- **Expected Outcome:** The expected results are displayed in the correct debugger windows

#### **Scenario 4: Cross platform compatibility**
- **Role Involved:** Developer/User
- **Objective:** The emulator must run on Windows and Linux
- **Preconditions:** Have a working PSX BIOS and game ROMs
- **Test Steps:**
 1. Build the emulator on Windows
 2. Launch the emulator
 3. Play a game
 4. Build the emulator on Linux
 5. Launch the emulator on Linux
 6. Play game

- **Expected Outcome:** Games are playable both on Windows and Linux

#### **Scenario 5: Controller support / keybind customization**
- **Role Involved:** Developer/User
- **Objective:** The emulator must run on Windows and Linux
- **Preconditions:** Have a working PSX BIOS and game ROMs
- **Test Steps:**
 1. Launch the emulator
 2. Open key settings
 3. Change settings to custom bindings
 4. Play a game

- **Expected Outcome:** The game is playable and the the keybindings are properly mapped

## **5. Conclusion**
The **Beta Test Plan** allows us to validate core functionalities and uncover possible bugs.
We focus on stability, performance, and usability, this beta phase ensures the emulator can play a small set of games. This beta phase will help us improve the emulator by finding issues and think of new features to prepare for the first release version of the project, including better compatibility, save functionality, and enhanced audio.
